    <h2 style="color: red; border: thin black solid;">NY Comic Con</h2>
    <p> Ever been around Midtown in early October and noticed a bunch of people dressed in costume and wondered <em>why are these people dressed in costume? It's a bit too early for Halloween!</em> Those people you encountered were more than likely dressed in costume because they were attending NY Comic Con. NY Comic Con also known as 'Nerdvana,' takes place in NYC every Fall at the Jacob Javits Center. Since it's inception, it has grown from being a two-day event to being a four-day event due to popular demand. Moreover, the convention started off just being held in one section of the Javits Center to now taking over the entire space. Fans from all over the world come to the city for this event to commiserate with fellow comic book and pop culture fans. This convention offers workshops, panels, meetups and contests that badge holders can participate in. </p>
    <p> My first experience attending Comic Con was in October 2015. One of the main events of the convention that particular year was the 25th anniversary of the sci-fi film, "Back to the Future." Fans dressed up as the mad scientist and Marty McFly in order to earn the rare and beloved Crystal Pepsi. The friend I attended the con with dressed up as <em>Marty McFly</em>. He was able to earn not one but <strong>TWO</strong> Crystal Pepsi bottles! There was a huge setup to celebrate the movie reaching that milestone including having a DeLereon set up in the middle of the main floor at the Javits Center. It was a great and ominous exprience seeing so many people cosplay as characters from the film. My friend felt right at home being in a center full of fellow Marty McFlys. </p>
    <p> Beyond the panels and workshops the con offers, there is a <strong>HUGE</strong> showroom floor that takes up the bulk of the main floor in the Javits Center. The showroom floor consists of vendors, publishing companies, illustrators, artists and interactive booths for fans to explore and enjoy. I particularly enjoy talking with the various independent comic book publishers who are more than willing to speak to fans about the work their company produces. The vendors is another great aspect of the showroom floor as many of them sell rare and unique comic book and pop culture merchandise that you either haven't seen before or won't be able to find anywhere else. Many of the comic book stores that are located in the city such as Midtown Comics and Forbidden Planet also have booths at the convention and even offer fans discount codes to use on merchandise at the convention or at their brick and mortar locations. </p>
    <p> Seeing the cosplay alone will drive any fan of comic books and pop culture to purchase a pass to Comic Con. <em>What is cosplay?</em> Cosplay, according to the Merriam Webster dictionary is "the practice of dressing up as a character from a movie, book, or video game, especially one from the Japanese genres of manga and anime." I have seen <strong>SOME AMAZING</strong> cosplay (see below). The best cosplayers I have seen have been those who created their looks from head to toe from <strong>SCRATCH.</strong> The cosplayers that have brought a literal smile to my face have been those who dressed as characters that made me nostalgic of my childhood. The convention holds contests for cosplayers who compete against one another for a monetary prize ("money, money, money, MON-EY!"). </p>
    <p> For all the panels, workshops, vendors, interactive booths and fan meetups, the convention isn't expensive to attend! The weekend days (Friday through Saturday) are priced at a higher level ($50) while Thursday and Sunday are $40 to attend currently. Due to the construction happening at the Javits until further notice, the passes were sold by day without the three or four day pass option like previous years. If you would plan to attend the con for more than one day, the three or four day pass would ideally be the best option as you would save money rather than purchasing individual day passes.</p>

      <h2  style="color: red; border: thin black solid;">Sakura Matsuri Festival</h2>
    <p> Sakura Matsuri takes place at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden during the height of Cherry Blossom Season. This event attracts all kinds of people over to Brooklyn as the cherry blossoms are quite the site to see when they are fully in bloom.

    <h2 style="color: red; border: thin black solid;"> Farm Fresh Tour</h2>
    <p> I learned about the Farm Fresh Tours from a friend of mine who moved here from Birmingham, AL. She informed me that the Metro-North offers one day getaway packages that provide you with a tour as well as a round-trip rail ticket for one set price which is listed on the Metro-North Getaways and Packages website. Each tour that is offered via the Metro-North comes with an intinerary of activities. The itinerary lists the expected arrivals and departures of each stop on the tour. </p>
    <p> The first tour that I attended was the <em>Farm Fresh Ice Cream and Wine Tour.</em> There is a special ticket that you have to get in order to attend the tour. Since it was my first time attending one of their tours, I went to the ticket booth and asked the ticket person for the Farm Fresh Tour ticket package. I received two tickets: a round trip ticket for the train and a ticket for the tour which I was instructed to show to the tour bus guide. The itinerary instructed to take the Hudson Line to the last stop: Poughkeepsie which is about two hours away from NYC.</p>
    <p> I've taken the Metro-North many times but this was my very first time riding on the green line, better known as the Hudson Line. The Hudson line rides alongside the Hudson River. It is a SIGHT to see especially during the Fall. Make sure you sit on the side where the train rides beside the river so that you can take in the amazing views of the scenery. During the Fall, it is an absolutely stunning view as the foliage settles in. Although the train ride is two hours long, it doesn't feel like it as it is such an easy going train ride. However, this particular line on the Metro-North especially during the Summer and Fall seasons is rather popular. Make sure you arrive early to secure a seat on the train. There are many hiking and biking trails that New Yorkers like to do during the weekends. While I was on the train, it got so packed that people were standing in the aisle all the way to Beacon, which is two stops away from Poughkeepsie, the last stop. </p>

    <h2 style="color: red; border: thin black solid;"> 29 Rooms</h2>
    <p> 29 Rooms is curated and produced by media outlet Refinery29. In it's third year, it has become one of the hottest tickets to snag during NYC Fashion Week (Fall). I just so happened to have received an email about the event months in advance. Little did the email sender know that I had been waiting in anticipation for this year's event as the photos that I saw from 2016 on social media blew my mind away.</p>

    <h2 style="color: red; border: thin black solid;"> Afro Punk Festival</h2>
    <p>
     Afro Punk takes place at the end of every August in the heart of downtown Brooklyn at Commodore Barry Park. In its formative years, admission to the event was donation based however since the event has wildly grown in popularity, prospective attendees must purchase tickets. I've attended this event both when it was "free 99" and when they began charging to attend. In my personal opinion, I enjoyed the event more when I paid to attend simply because the organization of the event was a lot more polished. They offered more activities, bigger musical acts and a greater variety in food vendors. The first year I went, my friends and I had to leave the park in order to purchase some food to eat. We returned after we ate but having to walk and find something to eat, to have to return to the festival afterwards was CUMBERSOME. However, back then festival goers were allowed to reenter after leaving. Now, there is no re-entrance.
