    <h2>NY Comic Con</h2>
    <p> Ever been around Midtown in early October and noticed a bunch of people dressed in costume and wondered <em>why are these people dressed in costume? It's a bit too early for Halloween!</em> Those people you encountered were more than likely dressed in costume because they were attending NY Comic Con. NY Comic Con also known as 'Nerdvana,' takes place in NYC every Fall at the Jacob Javits Center. Since it's inception, it has grown from being a two-day event to being a four-day event due to popular demand. Moreover, the convention started off just being held in one section of the Javits Center to now taking over the entire space. Fans from all over the world come to the city for this event to commiserate with fellow comic book and pop culture fans. This convention offers workshops, panels, meetups and contests that badge holders can participate in. </p>
    <p> My first experience attending Comic Con was in October 2015. One of the main events of the convention that particular year was the 25th anniversary of the sci-fi film, "Back to the Future." Fans dressed up as the mad scientist and Marty McFly in order to earn the rare and beloved Crystal Pepsi. The friend I attended the con with dressed up as <em>Marty McFly</em>. He was able to earn not one but <strong>TWO</strong> Crystal Pepsi bottles! There was a huge setup to celebrate the movie reaching that milestone including having a DeLereon set up in the middle of the main floor at the Javits Center. It was a great and ominous exprience seeing so many people cosplay as characters from the film. My friend felt right at home being in a center full of fellow Marty McFlys. </p>
        <img class="mainpage" src="images/cosplay2.jpg">
        <h4> My friend Samuel cosplaying as Marty McFly along with two actors hired by the convention to portray Marty and Dr. Emmett Brown (2015)</h4>
    <p> Beyond the panels and workshops the con offers, there is a <strong>HUGE</strong> showroom floor that takes up the bulk of the main floor in the Javits Center. The showroom floor consists of vendors, publishing companies, illustrators, artists and interactive booths for fans to explore and enjoy. I particularly enjoy talking with the various independent comic book publishers who are more than willing to speak to fans about the work their company produces. The vendors is another great aspect of the showroom floor as many of them sell rare and unique comic book and pop culture merchandise that you either haven't seen before or won't be able to find anywhere else. Many of the comic book stores that are located in the city such as Midtown Comics and Forbidden Planet also have booths at the convention and even offer fans discount codes to use on merchandise at the convention or at their brick and mortar locations. </p>

        <h4> One of the artists commissioned by the convention to recreate comic book related figures and images using only Jelly Belly jelly beans. (2015)</h4>
    <p> Seeing the cosplay alone will drive any fan of comic books and pop culture to purchase a pass to Comic Con. <em>What is cosplay?</em> Cosplay, according to the Merriam Webster dictionary is "the practice of dressing up as a character from a movie, book, or video game, especially one from the Japanese genres of manga and anime." I have seen <strong>SOME AMAZING</strong> cosplay (see below). The best cosplayers I have seen have been those who created their looks from head to toe from <strong>SCRATCH.</strong> The cosplayers that have brought a literal smile to my face have been those who dressed as characters that made me nostalgic of my childhood. The convention holds contests for cosplayers who compete against one another for a monetary prize ("money, money, money, MON-EY!"). </p>

        <img class="mainpage" src="images/cosplay8.jpg">
        <h4> Susan Storm and the Thing from Marvel's "Fantastic Four" franchise.</h4>
     
    <p> For all the panels, workshops, vendors, interactive booths and fan meetups, the convention isn't expensive to attend! The weekend days (Friday through Saturday) are priced at a higher level ($50) while Thursday and Sunday are $40 to attend currently. Due to the construction happening at the Javits until further notice, the passes were sold by day without the three or four day pass option like previous years. If you would plan to attend the con for more than one day, the three or four day pass would ideally be the best option as you would save money rather than purchasing individual day passes.</p>
    
    <h3 class="list"> Pros:</h3>
    <ul class="list"> 
        <li> If you live in the  tri-state area, this event is a comic book nerd's paradise.</li>
        <li> Lots of rare and unique collectibles are sold exclusively at this event.</li>
        <li> Comic Con offers an opportunity to meet lots of likeminded people that you may not have met otherwise in the city.</li>
        <li> You get to screen lots of new upcoming shows before anyone else!</li>
        <li> You get to talk face to face with lots of artists, illustrators and publishers. Moreover, if you have a dream of creating your own comic book series, this is the place for you to network!</li>
        <li> You get the opportunity to hear people in the industry speak.</li>
        <li> There are now designated areas in the convention center for resting if you tire yourself out from walking around all day.</li>
        <li> There is now cosplay repair! If anything happens to your costume while at the con, there are people on site that can fix it for you. Bonus, it's free of charge!</li>
    </ul>
     <h3 class="list"> Cons:</h3>
     <ul class="list">
        <li> Overcrowdness!</li> 
        <li> No re-entry! Once your badge is scanned by a staff member, there is no such thing as being able to re-enter the Javits once you've scanned your badge out!</li>
        <li> Long bathroom lines!</li>
        <li> There aren't enough food options are availble inside the convention center! There are a bunch of food trucks lined up outside the center but that would require that you eat outside FIRST before entering the center.</li>
        <li> If you're looking for particular merchandise, especially merchandise centered on comic book characters of color, many vendors don't sell it. For example, none of the vendors had any Storm graphic tees available for purchase. Why is that especially when she is such a titular character in the Marvel universe??</li>

    <h2> Farm Fresh Tour</h2>
    <p> I learned about the Farm Fresh Tours from a friend of mine who moved here from Birmingham, AL. She informed me that the Metro-North offers one day getaway packages that provide you with a tour as well as a round-trip rail ticket for one set price which is listed on the Metro-North Getaways and Packages website. Each tour that is offered via the Metro-North comes with an intinerary of activities. The itinerary lists the expected arrivals and departures of each stop on the tour. </p>
    <p> The first tour that I attended was the <em>Farm Fresh Ice Cream and Wine Tour.</em> There is a special ticket that you have to get in order to attend the tour. Since it was my first time attending one of their tours, I went to the ticket booth and asked the ticket person for the Farm Fresh Tour ticket package. I received two tickets: a round trip ticket for the train and a ticket for the tour which I was instructed to show to the tour bus guide. The itinerary instructed to take the Hudson Line to the last stop: Poughkeepsie which is about two hours away from NYC.</p>
    <p> I've taken the Metro-North many times but this was my very first time riding on the green line, better known as the Hudson Line. The Hudson line rides alongside the Hudson River. It is a SIGHT to see especially during the Fall. Make sure you sit on the side where the train rides beside the river so that you can take in the amazing views of the scenery. During the Fall, it is an absolutely stunning view as the foliage settles in. Although the train ride is two hours long, it doesn't feel like it as it is such an easy going train ride. However, this particular line on the Metro-North especially during the Summer and Fall seasons is rather popular. Make sure you arrive early to secure a seat on the train. There are many hiking and biking trails that New Yorkers like to do during the weekends. While I was on the train, it got so packed that people were standing in the aisle all the way to Beacon, which is two stops away from Poughkeepsie, the last stop. </p>
    <p> The tour we took made FOUR stops. The first stop was in the town of Mill Brook. We were given a little over an hour to explore the downtown area of this small rural town. There, I spotted restaurants, of which many of them are farm to table, locally sourcing their produce that is grown nearby. There were also many antiques shops which I loved (You never know what you could find!). My friends and I stopped into Aurelia, an Italian-New American restaurant. The owner gave some food off their menu to try: Gnocchi and Tiramisu. Both were incredibly fresh and delicious (I'll be back!).</p>
     <img class="mainpage" src="images/farmfresh2.jpg">
     <h4> The film crew posing for a group photo. Can you spot me?? </h4>
    <p> The next stop that we made was at Clinton Vineyards. Did you know that NY state is home to over one thousand vineyards? I didn't know either until I went on this tour and discovered that New York State is Wine Country, haha. The owner of the vineyard and his wife who now runs the operations there were both born and raised in the Bronx! At this stop, there was a wine tasting and the owner's wife explains to everyone what goes into producing each wine that is being offered to sample. During the 2016 Presidential Race and while Former President Clinton presided in office, the vineyard developed and produced a 'Presidential Wine' that they sold for a limited time. Inside the gift shop, there are many photos of the owners along with the Clintons hanging on the walls. </p>
        <img class="mainpage" src="images/farmfresh.jpg">
        <h4>The view at Clinton Vineyards, one of the stops on the tour.</h4>
    <p> Following Clinton Vineyards, the bus drove us to Meadowlands Farm. As soon as I stopped off the bus, my nose got a whiff of fresh apple cider and apple cider donuts. I bought several donuts--they were delicious, fresh and served warm! The farm covers a lot of acreage. I saw some donkeys wondering nearby the fence and decided to go and play with them while my friends shopped in the market. All of the produce that they offer at Meadowlands is completely organic and GMO-free. Part of the magic of this farm is that they allow local farmers to come and cultivate crops for a small fee in order to encourage local business growth and opportunity for those interested to learn how to farm. While there, I also learned that the farm was a stop on the Underground Railroad. The farmers during that time period would hide and stow away runaway slaves. </p>
        <img class="mainpage" src="images/farmfresh1.jpg">
        <h4> Interacting with one of the donkeys at the farm, one of the tour destinations.</h4>    
    <p> The last but not least stop of the tour was at Zoey's Ice Cream Barn. Zoey, the owner is a Culinary Institute of America graduate who decided to open up her own ice cream parlor after graduation. The ice cream at Zoey's is said to go from cow to cone in just three days; in fact, it is stated right outside the barn on the storefornt sign. Anyone who knows me well knows how much I love ice cream. I have had my fair share of ice cream over the years but by far, the ice cream from Zoey's has to be the freshest ice cream I have ever had! Moreover, since the tour was in the Fall, the menu offered a lot of seasonal flavors. In case you're wondering, they do offer a pumpkin flavor. I ordered it and it was AMAZING! </p>
    <h3 class="list"> Pros:</h3>
    <ul class="list"> 
        <li> The tour ticket is under $50! It includes a round trip ticket on the Metro-North from Grand Central to Poughkeepsie as well as a tour bus that takes you to and from each tour destination.</li>
        <li> The train ride along the Hudson River is magnificent!</li>
        <li> As a tour attendee, you receive a lovely water cooler bag with the Dutchess County insignia outside of it.</li>
        <li> You get the opportunity to purchase organic produce at a lower price than what is offered in the city!</li>
        <li> You have the chance to eat at restaurants that are all farm to table; the food is super fresh and locally sourced!</li>
        <li> You get to meet new people!</li>
        <li> You get to escape the hustle and bustle of the city for a day and you didn't have to take a flight somewhere! </li>
        <li> Dutchess County Tourism is extremely responsive to any questions or concerns you may have about the tour. They want people to come and invest in their county. </li>
    </ul>
     <h3 class="list"> Cons:</h3>
     <ul class="list">
        <li> Some of the tour stops felt too short! I wish we got to spend more time at each of the stops.</li> 
        <li> You must catch the train that is listed on the itinerary; everything is set up so that you arrive in town for the tour bus to pick you up. If you miss the train, you miss the tour.</li>
        <li> Since most of the tours occur on the weekends, the trains to come back into the city don't nearly run as often as the trains that arrive from the city. Prepare for long waits.</li>
        <li> Depending on the time of year you arrive to this part of NY, the weather is colder than the city because it is further up north. Prepare to dress warmly.</li>
     </ul>

    <h2> 29 Rooms</h2>
    <p> 29 Rooms is curated and produced by media outlet Refinery29. In it's third year, it has become one of the hottest tickets to snag during NYC Fashion Week (Fall). I just so happened to have received an email about the event months in advance. Little did the email sender know that I had been waiting in anticipation for this year's event as the photos that I saw from 2016 on social media blew my mind away.</p>
    <p> Refinery 29 converts a warehouse in the city (Brooklyn) into 29 rooms that you can enter and fully immerse yourself into a different experience. Each of the rooms are curated by either an artist, company or celebrity. Some of the rooms have greater causes such as gender equality or mental health awareness. Some of the rooms require hands-on participation. For example, this year one of the rooms was designed by the actor Jake Gyllenhaal. His room asked for people to write down something they're afraid of on a sheet of paper. Once complete, there are shredders set up throughout the room where you can shred the paper with your fear written on it; it served as a way to release whatever fear a person may be holding onto. The room itself was filled with shredded piles of paper, all paper from the exercise of participants.</p>
    <p> This year, there were several rooms that had politcal overtones. There was a room that had a gender neutral bathroom installed to call to attention that all states should implement these into their businesses and more. There was another room that was about the Women's Rights March on Washington. It included a table full of postcards and a binder where you could find your local senator or representative and write to them about whatever issues you have.</p>
    <img class="mainpage" src= "images/29rooms9.JPG">
    <h4> One of the politically motivated rooms! </h4>
    <p> MY favorite room/experience was the room sponsored by Ulta Beauty. Inside this space was a carousel! The carousel had life size models of makeup products such as lipstick, a compact, and a nail polish bottle. Additionally, you could ride the carousel! It moved! At the end of the ride, my friend and I were escorted to an area where they had several vending machines that were filled with makeup products. They gave away free makeup! The portions were small but it was a free giveaway; that's a win-win in my book!</p>
    <img class="mainpage" src= "images/29rooms10.JPG">
    <h4> The carousel of any woman's dreams! </h4>

    <h4> A room made entirely of flowers; photo taken by Victor Castro</h4>
    <img class="mainpage" src= "images/29Rooms1.JPG">
    <h4> A room designed and curated by actress Emma Roberts. In this room, there were books lined up  along the walls with blank pages encouraging participants to write in them. </h4>
    <img class="mainpage" src= "images/29rooms4.JPG">
    <h4> This room required participants to become apart of the masterpiece (wallpaper). On the sides of  the room were tables with props that were painted like the sides of the room. I borrowed an overcoat, top hat and sunglasses that matched with the side of the room I chose to stand in front of.</h4>
     <h3 class="list"> Pros:</h3>
    <ul class="list"> 
        <li> It is a hands-on experience that calls for your active participation.</li>
        <li> It allows you to experience art in a new way. </li>
        <li> It is a great photo opportunity; in fact, Refinery 29 encourages all attendees to take as many photos as they like and post it on their social media accounts. It is an Instagrammer's paradise and playground.</li>
        <li> It is apart of NY Fall Fashion Week! </li>
        <li> Now the event incorporates many of the local vendors and businesses; if you have a ticket to the event, you can receive discounts and deals at many of the local restaurants and businesses.</li>
        <li> It's accessible via mass transit.</li>
    </ul>
     <h3 class="list"> Cons:</h3>
     <ul class="list">
        <li> Overcrowdedness.</li> 
        <li> There are long lines outside many of the rooms which can prevent someone attending the event from visiting ALL 29 rooms.</li>
        <li> When purchasing a ticket, every person is asked to choose a time slot. Each person is only given three hours to explore all 29 rooms. Considering the amount of people who attended during my time slot (which was the earliest), it didn't give my friend and I nearly enough time to visit all the rooms because the lines were so long. </li>
        <li> There are no outside food or drinks besides bottled water allowed.</li>
     </ul>

    <h2> Afro Punk Festival</h2>
    <p>
     Afro Punk takes place at the end of every August in the heart of downtown Brooklyn at Commodore Barry Park. In its formative years, admission to the event was donation based however since the event has wildly grown in popularity, prospective attendees must purchase tickets. I've attended this event both when it was "free 99" and when they began charging to attend. In my personal opinion, I enjoyed the event more when I paid to attend simply because the organization of the event was a lot more polished. They offered more activities, bigger musical acts and a greater variety in food vendors. The first year I went, my friends and I had to leave the park in order to purchase some food to eat. We returned after we ate but having to walk and find something to eat, to have to return to the festival afterwards was CUMBERSOME. However, back then festival goers were allowed to reenter after leaving. Now, there is no re-entrance.
    </p>

        <h4> R&B artist and producer, Raphaael Sadiq performing on the Main Stage Sunday night of the festival (2017)</h4>
        
    <p>
    One of the great aspects about this festival is the fashion! Afro Punk encourages people to be free and be themselves; many of those who attend create elaborate outfits to wear to the festival. Many of the outfits that people wear incorporate aspects of African and African-American culture and history into their outfits. It is truly a sight to see so much so that many who attend bring professional cameras along with them to document this.    
    </p>
        <img class="mainpage" src="images/afropunk4.jpg">
    <h4> "Big hair, don't care!" Some of this year's attendees. </h4>
    <h3 class="list"> Pros:</h3>
    <ul class="list"> 
        <li> It is a safe space for people of color to come together to celebrate and bask in our uniqueness.</li>
        <li> If you've ever felt like an outsider because you were different from the people in your vicinity, Afro Punk is a festival that brings together all the people of color who have ever felt different or weird from their peers. </li>
        <li> It is a great opportunity to see some of your favorite artists and bands perform live! The bonus is you also get to see acts you may have never heard of before also! </li>
        <li> There are many vendors, local artisans that sell their merchandise at this event. Here, you'll find one of a kind pieces that will turn heads. </li>
        <li> Year after year, the food options continue to expand. Now the food truck area has expanded to stretch down two avenues!</li>
        <li> It's accessible via mass transit.</li>
        <li> This event not only offers live performances to listen and jive to but also offers lots of interactive activities also that are scattered throughout Commodore Barry Park. There are many political activations to push people, especially youg people of color to become more politcally engaged.</li>
        <li> Afro Punk is signing bigger musical acts to perform at the festival.</li>
        <li> Afro Punk is one of the first festivals to implement Gender Neutral bathrooms. </li>
        <li> There are charging stations for festival goers to charge their devices whilst waiting for their favorite musical act to hit the stage.</li>
        <li> There is an app that Afro Punk created that details the time and location each artist performs so you can strategize accordingly.</li>
    </ul>
     <h3 class="list"> Cons:</h3>
     <ul class="list">
        <li> Overcrowdedness.</li> 
        <li> There aren't nearly enough bathrooms, in my opinion, to accomodate for the amount of people that attend this event.</li>
        <li> They charge to attend this event now! It used to be FREE! </li>
        <li> There are no outside food or drinks besides bottled water allowed in order to encourage festival goers to invest in the food trucks and vendors they enlisted for the festival.</li>
        <li> There is no RE-ENTRY. Once your ticket is scanned at the front, that is IT. You're locked in for the remainder of the time you decide to arrive.</li>
        <li> Many  of the top artists on the festival bill are scheduled to perform during the same time period on different stages. I've had issues where I had to position myself in such a way where I can enjoy one artist but I timed myself to leave at a particular time so that I could make a mad dash to another stage to see another artist's performance. </li>

    <h2> Jazz Age Lawn Party </h2>
    <p>
    The Jazz Age Lawn Party occurs twice a year during the Summer on Governor's Island. In order to get to Governor's Island, there is a ferry that you can board that is located next to the South Ferry Terminal. The ticket to the event gives you a round trip boarding pass for the ferry. 
    </p>
    <p> Once my friends and I boarded the ferry to Governor's Island, I felt like I was a world away. The ferry was like a time machine that took us from present day to the height of the Roaring Twenties. Every one that was aboard the ferry was dressed in garb from that time period. It was a bright and sunny outside, not a cloud in sight; it was a perfect day to picnic outside.</p>
    <p> There was a long line to enter into the event itself but the line moved quickly as there were designated area for VIP ticketholders and regular ticketholders. Once inside the event, you are met with a row of vendors selling food, clothing and accessories from the 1920s. However, my eyes were drawn to the grand stage where a live band was playing. In front of the stage was a large wooden dancefloor where people could dance if they wanted to. When the opportunity presented itself, people stopped what they were doing and got on the dancefloor busting out moves from way back when such as 'The Charleston.'  There were also performances from a dance company that specializes in 1920s dance that performed a few pieces during my time there. Watching these performances was exciting; it felt like watching a silent movie in live action.</p>
    <p> What captivated me the most about this event in particular was how people were dressed. It was so impressive! A lot of people in attendance put a lot of time, money and effort into developing an outfit that was befitting of the event. I was so entralled by the costuming that I asked attendees if I could take their picture. All of them luckily agreed to do it. </p>
    <h3 class="list"> Pros:</h3>
    <ul class="list"> 
        <li> It is one HUGE themed celebration: The Roaring Twenties!</li>
        <li> It is an opportunity to get dressed up in costume and see others dress in costume! </li>
        <li> The day is filled with live performances from a band with various artists singing as well as performances done by a dance company. </li>
        <li> It is a great opportunity to come to a park that feels like a world away from the city but you're still technically in the city. </li>
        <li> You are allowed to bring your own food and drink. In fact, pinicking is encouraged! </li>
        <li> It's accessible via mass transit.</li>
        <li> This event brings together a lot of people from all over the country who come to the city specifically to attend this special event.</li>
        <li> There is a designated play area set up for those who attend the event with their little ones.</li>
